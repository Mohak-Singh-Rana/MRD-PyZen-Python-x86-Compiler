# MRD PyZen: Python-x86 Compiler

## Overview

`MRD PyZen: Python-x86 Compiler` is a project aimed to implement a compilation toolchain, where the input is in Python language and the output is x86_64 code. 
The python code output is generated from the assembly code using the GNU assembler.

## Instructions for Compilation
* Please change directory into ./scripts/
* Execute: ./run.sh filepath (path should be relative to current directory)
* The generated output is displayed on terminal and the corresponding 3AC, symbol table and ASM code for the given python code are generated in the outputs folder

## Instructions for running testcases
* We have provided 5 non-trivial programs for compilation using the given compiler
* We have provided a bash script to automate the testing of these testcases
* Please change directory into ./scripts/
* Execute ./checking script.sh
* The tests are named ./tests/test [1-5].py , corresponding outputs generated by code after compilation will be displayed on the terminal with respective labels. The 3AC, CSV and ASM files will be generated in respective folders of ./outputs/ for each of test[1-5]
